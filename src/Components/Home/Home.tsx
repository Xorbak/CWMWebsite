            The saftey of our residents are our number one priority. Therefore
            we have 24/7 security with Kallvest that will manage the day to day
            security needs. For emergency situations BSS security will be
            contacted for an armed response. More so, our electric perimiter
            fence immediately triggers an alarm when tampered with.
