              The saftey of our residents are our number one priority. Therefore
              we have 24/7 security with Kallvest that will manage the day to
              day security needs. For emergency situations BSS security will be
              contacted for an armed response. More so, our electric perimeter
              fence immediately triggers an alarm when tampered with.
